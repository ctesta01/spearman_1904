Why the chess background?

Ability in chess is often perceived as a stereotypical example of intelligence, but of course it's reasonable that a great chess player may be lacking in other areas of life such as social skills or emotional intelligence.

I'm not sure if we'll discuss "Emotional Intelligence" introduced by Salovey and Mayer in 1990, but it's worth thinking about where intelligence ends and other abilities begin as a limitation of the philosophy expressed by Spearman behind the "g" factor.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Known for his work in psychology, Spearman was born in London in 1863 and died in 1945. His most famous work was on [human intelligence]{.emphasis}
-   He served in the army from 1883 to 1897, and then went to study at the University of Leipzig, where he was influenced by Wilhelm Wundt, the father of experimental psychology, or ["new psychology"]{.emphasis}
    -   I.e., used empirical methods instead of metaphysical reasoning
-   He was recalled to the army during the Second Boer War and served as a general
-   Somehow, amidst all this, he published his most famous work in [1904]{.emphasis}

# Structure of Spearman, 1904

After his introduction to the state of psychology and prior work, Spearman lays out his analysis plan for data collected on school children's performance in **"discrimination"** and **"intelligence"** tests.

He covers some preliminarys on how to calculate correlation coefficients, including a method for **"elimination of observational errors"** and **"elimination of irrelevant factors."** (It's on Chapter II, pg 252 that he introduces rank correlation).

For a series of experiments, he presents the results of his correlational analyses with particular emphasis on 1) *detrending for age*, and 2) investigating *which of the tests are correlated with each other*.

Finally, he concludes with an analysis of the **"General Intelligence" factor**.

## Data used

Spearman collected the following data:

-   Experiment I used the 24 oldest children tested in **Light**, **Weight**, and **Sound**
-   Experiment II used the next 36 oldest children with tests only on **Sound**, *interviewed collectively*.
-   Experiment III on **Sight** and **Weight** discrimination among boys from a preparatory school
-   Experiment IV on **Sound** only in the high class preparatory school boys, with only particular intervals tested
-   Experiment V, similar to experiment I with boys and girls, but aiming for **higher variation** rather than homogeneity

## Intelligence Measures

-   Examination scores and school rankings were thought to reveal ["Present Capacity"]{.emphasis}
-   School rankings divided by age were dubbed ["Native Capacity"]{.emphasis}
-   Teachers were asked to rank students based on their ["general impression"]{.emphasis} (e.g., based on if they seemed "bright", "average", "dull")
-   Using a similar technique, the oldest of the children of Series I was asked to rank peer students based on their ["common sense"]{.emphasis}, and then the next oldest child was asked to do the same.

## Let's Check His Math

What is the "probable error" of a correlation coefficient?

::: fragment
I'm not immediately sure about the distribution for Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, but Pearson's product-moment correlation has a known distribution.
:::

::: fragment
The distribution for a sample correlation coefficient for correlated random normal variables is a little bit crazy...

$$
f(r) = \frac{(n-2) \Gamma(n-1)(1 - \rho^2)^{\frac{n-1}{2}} (1-r^2)^{\frac{n-4}{2}}}{ \sqrt{2\pi} \Gamma(n-\frac{1}{2})(1-\rho r)^{n - \frac{3}{2}} } {}_{2}{F}_1\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}; \frac{1}{2}(2n-1); \frac{1}{2}(\rho r + 1)\right)
$$
:::

::: fragment
But for uncorrelated variables (the null hypothesis), the distribution is much simpler:

$$
f(r) = \frac{\left( \frac{1}{1-r^2}\right)^{-\frac{n-1}{2}}}{
  \sqrt{n-2} B\left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{n-2}{2} \right)
},
$$

where $B$ is the Beta function and ${}_2{F}_1$ is the Gaussian hypergeometric function.

So what do we think? <br>

Do we think he [genuinely found evidence]{.emphasis} for a [common factor]{.emphasis} shared by all forms/measures of intelligence? <br>

And if not, where did his reasoning go wrong? <br>

I thought it was often hard to understand what he was saying, especially around the calculations.

-   Merits:
    -   Asking teachers to rank their students on qualities like ["common sense"]{.emphasis} and ["general impression"]{.emphasis} was novel and what I would call an early 'psychometric instrument'
      - [Such an instrument might have reasonable reliability, but its validity 
suffers from the fact that it's based on potentially biased impressions of teachers.]{.small}
    -   He was extraordinarily early in analyzing correlation matrices (though I'm not sure he formatted them like matrices) and recognizing their potential to have deeper structure.
    -   His work raises interesting questions about where "intelligence" ends and other skills begin.
    - His literature review is fascinating.
:::

:::{.incremental}
-   Demerits:
    -   He offers no reflection how culture and (inherently subjective) definitions
    of intelligence interact.
    -   The text can be a **bit clunky**, and I think that's because he didn't have the language we have now like "Let $X$ be a random variable."
    -   While he does at times seem to be careful about calling for more investigation into what the General Intelligence factor is, *he very quickly concludes that 'General Intelligence' "really exists."*
:::


# Contemporary Uses of Factor Analysis {background-color="#1C5253"}

Factor analysis has since been used in many fields, but especially 
[psychology]{.emphasis}. 
It is common to see factor analysis 
in survey analysis (Qualtrics has a [guide](https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/research/factor-analysis/)).

:::{.fragment}
One workflow is to have respondents rate their agreement with a series of
statements, then latent factors are identified from the responses using factor
analysis, and factor scores describe *how much variance of each observed
variable is explained
by each of the latent factors*.
:::

:::{.fragment}
Spearman's work only posited the existence of **one** common 
factor for intelligence measures, but after its development by 
Thurstone in the 1930-50s, [factor analysis with multiple factors
is now common.]{.emphasis}
