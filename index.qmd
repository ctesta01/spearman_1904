## Who was Charles Spearman?

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

  - Known for his work in psychology, Spearman was born in London in 1863 and died in 1945. His most 
  famous work was on [human intelligence]{.emphasis}
  - He served in the army from 1883 to 1897, and then went to study at the University of Leipzig, where he was influenced by Wilhelm Wundt, the father of experimental psychology, or ["new psychology"]{.emphasis}
    - I.e., used empirical methods instead of 
    metaphysical reasoning
  - He was recalled to the army during the Second Boer War and served as a general
  - Somehow, amidst all this, he published 
  his most famous work in [1904]{.emphasis}

## Who was Charles Spearman?

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

  - Spearman was heavily persuaded by Galton's work, particularly the 
  creation of ["Co-relation"]{.emphasis} from 1888. 
    - [See, for example, Stigler's 1989 article [Francis Galton's Account of the Invention of Correlation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2245329?seq=5)]{.small}
  - He was also influenced by the work of the French psychologist Alfred Binet, who was working on the first intelligence tests, e.g., ["intelligence quotients"]{.emphasis}
  - His seminal 1904 work posits that intelligence rests on a single, general (latent) factor, which he called ["g"]{.emphasis}
    - This was the first work in the field now called [factor analysis]{.emphasis}
  - He also developed [rank correlation]{.emphasis}

## What were his motivations in writing?

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width='55%'}
:::
:::{.column width='45%'}
<br>
<br>

He sees psychology as an up-and-coming field, and yet 
also a subject looked down-upon by the scientific community. 

<br><br>

He's trying to make a case for psychology as a science, rooted in 
data analysis and empirical methods.

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width='55%'}
:::
:::{.column width='45%'}
<br>
<br>

He is making clear he intends to lay down the [scientific 
foundations of psychology]{.emphasis}, which will be (implicitly) comparable to 
Newton's equations of motion â€” 

<br>
Especially with an eye towards 
refuting the criticisms of psychology as puttering about.

## What were his main arguments? 

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width='45%'}
<br><br>
Spearman was analyzing data on children's performance across various school
tests, and he found that the scores were correlated. 
<br><br>

In analyzing the data and their correlations, he hypothesized that 
there was a [single, general factor]{.emphasis} that was responsible for the correlations
and he called this [the "g" factor]{.emphasis}.

# So let's get into it {background-color="#1C5253" visibility="uncounted"}

:::{.incremental .large}
  - What was the [structure]{.emphasis2} of his 1904 paper?
  - What [data]{.emphasis2} did he use?
  - What were the [methodological innovations]{.emphasis2}? 
  - How did he [interpret]{.emphasis2} his findings?
  - What were the [implications]{.emphasis2} of his work?

# Plan for the rest of the slides

- Go over the rest of the 1904 paper 
- Have a section on contemporary uses of factor analysis
- Discuss the Bartholomew, Gould, Michell, and possibly Glymour papers
